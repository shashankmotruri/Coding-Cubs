                <h3><strong> Merge Sort : </strong></h3>
                <p>Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on the idea of breaking down a list into several sub-lists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list. </p>
                <p><strong>Idea:</strong> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide the unsorted list into N sublists, each containing 1 element.  </li>
                    <li>Take adjacent pairs of two singleton lists and merge them to form a list of 2 elements. N will now convert into N/2 lists of size 2.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the process till a single sorted list of obtained.  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>While comparing two sublists for merging, the first element of both lists is taken into consideration. While sorting in ascending order, the element that is of a lesser value becomes a new element of the sorted list. This procedure is repeated until both the smaller sublists are empty and the new combined sublist comprises all the elements of both the sublists.</p>
                <p><strong>Letâ€™s consider the following image</strong></p>
                <p><img width="680" alt="enter image description here" src="https://he-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/37deb43.jpg" /></p>
                <p>As one may understand from the image above, at each step a list of size M is being divided into 2 sublists of size M / 2, until no further division can be done. To understand better, consider a smaller array A containing the elements (9,7,8). </p>
                <p>At the first step this list of size 3 is divided into 2 sublists the first consisting of elements (9,7) and the second one being (8). Now, the first list consisting of elements (9,7) is further divided into 2 sublists consisting of elements (9) and (7) respectively.  </p>
                <p>As no further breakdown of this list can be done, as each sublist consists of a maximum of 1 element, we now start to merge these lists. The 2 sub-lists formed in the last step are then merged together in sorted order using the procedure mentioned above leading to a new list (7,9). Backtracking further, we then need to merge the list consisting of element (8) too with this list, leading to the new sorted list (7,8,9).</p>
                <p><br />
                    An implementation has been provided below : </p>
                <pre class="prettyprint"><code> void merge(int A[ ] , int start, int mid, int end) {
 //stores the starting position of both parts in temporary variables.
int p = start ,q = mid+1;

int Arr[end-start+1] , k=0;

for(int i = start ;i &lt;= end ;i++) {
    if(p &gt; mid)      //checks if first part comes to an end or not .
       Arr[ k++ ] = A[ q++] ;

   else if ( q &gt; end)   //checks if second part comes to an end or not
       Arr[ k++ ] = A[ p++ ];

   else if( A[ p ] &lt; A[ q ])     //checks which part has smaller element.
      Arr[ k++ ] = A[ p++ ];

   else
      Arr[ k++ ] = A[ q++];
 }
  for (int p=0 ; p&lt; k ;p ++) {
   /* Now the real array has elements in sorted manner including both
        parts.*/
     A[ start++ ] = Arr[ p ] ;
  }
}
</code></pre>
                <p>Here, in merge function, we will merge two parts of the arrays where one part has starting and ending positions from start to mid respectively and another part has positions from mid+1 to the end.  </p>
                <p>A beginning is made from the starting parts of both arrays. i.e. p and q. Then the respective elements of both the parts are compared and the one with the smaller value will be stored in the auxiliary array (Arr[ ]). If at some condition ,one part comes to end ,then all the elements of another part of array are added in the auxiliary array in the same order they exist.</p>
                <p>Now consider the following 2 branched recursive function : </p>
                <pre class="prettyprint"><code>   void merge_sort (int A[ ] , int start , int end )
   {
           if( start &lt; end ) {
           int mid = (start + end ) / 2 ;           // defines the current array in 2 parts .
           merge_sort (A, start , mid ) ;                 // sort the 1st part of array .
           merge_sort (A,mid+1 , end ) ;              // sort the 2nd part of array.

         // merge the both parts by comparing elements of both the parts.
          merge(A,start , mid , end );
   }
}
</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong><br />
                    The list of size N is divided into a max of log N parts, and the merging of all sublists into a single list takes O(N) time, the worst case run time of this algorithm is O(N Log N) </p>
